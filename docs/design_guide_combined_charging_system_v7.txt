Combined Charging System - Introduction 

The Combined Charging System is a universal charging system for electric which integrates all established AC 

charging solutions with ultra-fast DC charging in a single system. Only one charging interface will be required at 

the vehicle for single-phase AC charging, fast three-phase AC charging as well as ultra-fast d.c. charging at 

home or public stations. 

The Combined Charging System enhances today´s regional solutions towards one global integrated system. 

The Combined Charging System represents the future of fast charging and maximizes the integration of 

Combined 
Charging 
System

electric vehicles into future smart grids. 

The Combined Charging System is an open international standardized system.

Only public available Standards and Specification published by ISO/IEC and the relevant national Standard 

Bodies have to be used for product development. 

Disclaimer

The content of this Design Guide is not  binding nor can be exclusively used as basis for product development.

As some standards for the Combined Charging System are not finalized yet (status IS), the relevant standards 

for the Implementation of the Combined Charging System is organized by the 

Combined Charging System Specification.

The Design Guide is a simplified training guide which enables the reader to develop a fundamental understanding for the Combined

Charging System. The Guide explains and clarifies the system architecture, system activity, charging communication and safety

measures of the Combined Charging System. These information are based on relevant Standards and are therefore a starting point 

for station manufacturers and operators as well as suppliers.

▪ The System Architecture of the Combined Charging System serves for a systematic definition of 

the system activity. For each charge state the active electric components are identified and 
highlighted in the architectural diagram. The aspects covered include characteristics and operating 
conditions of the supply device and the connection to the vehicle.

Description of 
Safety 
Concept

▪ The Safety Concept describes the advanced safety functionalities of the Combined Charging 

System to avoid potential failures for DC Charging of EVs and to reduce main risks through defined 
exit strategies.

Illustration of Pulse Width Modulation 

The Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) is the utility for low level communication between EV and 
EVSE.

The PWM signal is applied to the circuit of control pilot and PE. The standard IEC 61851-1 is 
defining the meaning of the applicable duty cycle values. Three kind of information can be 
transmitted:
- Low duty cycle about 3 - 7% = digital communication required
- High duty cycles define the maximum current available
-

Invalid duty cycles mean “charging not possible”

The PWM signal is not specific for a.c. or d.c. charging. A.C. charging may use a duty cycle of 5%, 
which can be found in reality. Also, d.c. charging may use (in theory) a duty cycle of 8% or higher –
which would not be compliant with the CCS.
Please note that the duty cycle is controlled by the EVSE, whereas the voltage of the signal is 
controlled by the EV.

Introduction

▪ The following slides provide an overview of the states and sequences of the 

Pulse Width Modulation. It contains
▪ a description of the signal,
▪ for each state the appropriate function and
▪ for each sequence the identified and highlighted active electric components.

Illustration of SLAC I

The Signal Level Attenuation Characterization (SLAC) is a protocol to ensure EV and EVSE are physically 
connected to each other. SLAC as part of layer 2 (data link) is defined in HomePlug Green PHY v1.1.1 specification.

SLAC is a protocol to measure the attenuation between two Power Line Communication (PLC) modules.
If there are several EV’s that are connected to charging stations nearby, there can occur crosstalk in between.

SLAC requests shall be responded by an EVSE only, if the EVSE is connected to an EV (state B) and the PLC 
module of the EVSE is not  already linked to another PLC module (unmatched state).

Illustration of High Level Communication

The illustration of High Level Communication is a simplified systematic description of the 
communication between EV and DC Supply from start up after the plug-in of the charging cable.

The High Level Communication in DC charging takes place via power line communication (PLC) and 
is used for exchange of charging parameters e.g. voltage and current as well as information's like 
state of charge, remaining charging time, next maintenance. There is also the possibility to enable 
and operate a payment system via high level communication.

▪ Based on the Open System Interconnection-Layer-Model (OSI) the different 

stages of the communication between EV and DC supply have been 
investigated. 

▪ The following overview describes the stages of the High Level Communication. It 

contains

Introduction

▪ For each sequence the identified OSI Layers, beginning with the physical 

connection and proceeding step by step to the control application.

▪ Clarification what happens and which preconditions must be given so that 

EV and DC Supply can communicate with each other.

▪ A description of point to point relationship between PLC modules on EV and 

DC Supply.

Illustration of High Level Communication
OSI-Layer-Model

Pre-
condition

OSI-Layer 
Model

▪ For communication the DC charging system requires one dedicated Power Line 

Controler node on EV and DC Supply side

▪ The Communication is based on the OSI-Layer-Model containing 7 layers.

▪ Each of the 7 layers provides a dedicated task for the integrated communication 

process. 

▪ As a result each layer adds a data package to the message container.

▪ Communication can be established if sender and receiver are synchronized on 

the message container format.

OSI-Layer-Model Summary

Summary

▪

Each respective lower layer provides its services to the layer 
above via defined interfaces. 

▪ Messages (Application Process) has to be passed down through 

the protocol stack from upper to lower layers. Each Layer adds the 
specific header.

▪

▪

After EV has sent message over the lowest (physical medium) 
layer, the message passes upwards through all the higher layers 
at the Power Supply until it reaches the application layer. 
Each Layer subtract the specific header.

The whole process requires a logical interaction within each layer 
to complete the High Level Communication.

Safe State

▪ If the energy transfer has already started, the charging process would have to be terminated.
▪ This is ALWAYS a cascading chain of action that features several entry levels (3 level exit 

strategy):

1. Normal Shutdown via PLC, current ramp down at max. 100A/s in a standardized time 

window. If this is not successful, the next level will be triggered automatically.

Safe State
2. Emergency Shutdown via pilot, initiated by EV (Pilot-> B2) or station (Pilot –> B1), 
current ramp down at min. 200A/s in a standardized time window. If this is not 
successful, the next level will be triggered automatically.

There can be two different ways for the customer to start the charging
process:

I

II

1. Authenticate

1. Plug-in connector

2. Press „start“ button

2. Authenticate

3. Plug-in connector

3. Press „start“ button

For both sequences (especially for sequence II) it will be important to
implement waitingtime in the sequence for the customer to press the start
button.

For this time, please use a loop in the ContractAuthentication message. A 
waiting time for the customer at this period could be as long as 2 minutes
at the EVSE side.  So the customer can press the „start“-button at any
time until ContractAuthentication and will see a succesfull charging.

General information for EVSE‘s
Additional key points I

• Protection against environmental condition for the repository of the CCS Connector shall 

be considered.

•

IP-protection of cabinet/housing of charging station shall be considered. 

• All PE-lines shall be connected to one ground terminal to prevent different ground 

potentials between different boards.

• Documentation with reference to serial number of charging station shall include

information on implemented software version. 

• Requirement to send a response code like „failed“ if messages were send at the wrong
time shall be implemented according to DIN SPEC 70121:2014-12, [V2G-DC-666].

118

General information for EVSE‘s
Additional key points II

• CM_SLAC_MATCH.cnf from EVSE shall be send as unicast message

• Pilot voltage shall be in state B1 after coming from state B2, until connector is

plugged out. Oscillator shall not be started again.
